## About

who-dat is a self-hostable domain lookup service that turns the mess of RDAP and WHOIS into one clean JSON API.
It does the hard parts you can't do in a browser or get consistently elsewhere: discovering the right RDAP server per-TLD via IANA bootstrap, parsing nested jCard contact data, and normalizing every registry's output into one shape. It queries RDAP first, falls back to WHOIS, and returns a single consistent result.


## API Usage

> **TL;DR** Get the RDAP/WHOIS records for any site: `curl https://who-dat.as93.net/example.com`

For detailed request + response schemas, and to try the API out, you can reference the [spec](https://who-dat.as93.net/docs)

### Base URL

The base URL for the public API is [`who-dat.as93.net`](https://who-dat.as93.net)

If you're self-hosting (recommended) then replace this with your own base URL.

### Endpoints

<details>
  <summary><h4>Single Domain Lookup <code>/[domain]</code></h4></summary>

- **URL**: `/v1/whois/[domain]` (the bare `/[domain]` shorthand also works)
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Params**: `?raw=true` returns the original RDAP JSON or WHOIS text instead of the normalized response
- **Success Response**:
  - **Code**: 200 (the lookup succeeded, whether or not the domain is registered)
  - **Content**: Normalized WHOIS/RDAP data as JSON; the `isRegistered` field indicates registration status.
- **Error Response** (uniform envelope: `{ "error": { "code", "message", "query" } }`, plus `source`, `server`, and `detail` when known):
  - **400** - invalid or unparseable domain
  - **429** - rate limited (includes a `Retry-After` header)
  - **501** - no RDAP or WHOIS source for that TLD
  - **502** / **504** - upstream registry error or timeout
- **Sample Call**:

##### Command Line

```bash
curl https://who-dat.as93.net/example.com
```

##### JavaScript

```javascript
fetch('https://who-dat.as93.net/example.com')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

##### Python

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://who-dat.as93.net/example.com')
if response.status_code == 200:
    print(response.json())
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code)
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Multiple Domain Lookup <code>/multi</code></h4></summary>

- **URL**: `/multi`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Params**: 
  - **domains**: A comma-separated list of domains.
- **Success Response**:
  - **Code**: 200
  - **Content**: `{ "results": [ ... ] }` - an array of normalized results, one per domain.
- **Error Response**:
  - **Code**: 400 BAD REQUEST
  - **Content**: `{ "error": { "code": "INVALID_DOMAIN", "message": "missing domains parameter" } }`
- **Sample Call**:

```
curl "https://who-dat.as93.net/multi?domains=example.com,example.net"
```

## Deployment

#### Option 1: Vercel

This is the quickest and easiest way to get up-and-running. Simply fork the repository, then login to Vercel (using GitHub), and after importing your fork, it will be deployed! There's no additional config or keys needed, and it should work just fine on the free plan.

Alternatively, just hit the button below for 1-click deploy 👇

[![1-Click Deploy to Vercel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Vercel-ffffff?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel&labelColor=1b2744&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwho-dat.as93.net%2Fdocs)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flissy93%2Fwho-dat&demo-title=Who-Dat%20Demo&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwho-dat.as93.net&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ibb.co%2FJ5r1zCP%2Fwho-dat-square.png)

#### Option 2: Docker

The light-weight Docker image is published to DockerHub ([hub.docker.com/r/lissy93/who-dat](https://hub.docker.com/r/lissy93/who-dat)), as well as GHCR ([here](https://github.com/Lissy93/who-dat/pkgs/container/who-dat)).

Providing you've got Docker installed, you can get everything by running:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 --dns 8.8.8.8 --dns 8.8.4.4 lissy93/who-dat
```

[![Deploy from Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&labelColor=1b2744&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwho-dat.as93.net%2Fdocs)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lissy93/who-dat)


#### Option 3: Binary

Head to the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/Lissy93/who-dat/releases), download and extract the pre-built executable for your system, then run it.

<details>

<summary>Example</summary>

If you're using the command line, you can do something like this<br>
Don't forget to update (v1.0) with the version number you want, and (linux-amd64) with your system's architecture.
  
```bash
# Download the binary for your system (from releases tab)
wget https://github.com/Lissy93/who-dat/releases/download/v0.9/who-dat-v0.9-linux-amd64.tar.gz -O ./who-dat.tar.gz

# Extract the compressed file
tar -xzvf who-dat.tar.gz

# Make it executable
chmod +x who-dat

# Run Who-Dat!
./who-dat
```

(Or, if you're a Microsoft fanboy, you can just double-click the `who-dat.exe` after extracting in Windows Explorer)

</details>


#### Option 4: Build from Source

Follow the setup instructions in the [Development](#development) section.<br>
Then run `go build -o who-dat ./cmd/server` to generate the binary for your system.<br>
You'll then be able to execute the newly built `./who-dat` file directly to start the application.

---

## Configuration
There's a few optional environmental variables that you can set to configure certain features, limits and usage.

### Authentication

Authentication is optional, and can be enabled by setting the `AUTH_KEY` environment variable.
Once enabled, all API requests must include the key in the Authorization header, and unauthenticated requests will respond with a 403.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-secret-key>" https://who-dat.yourdomain.com/example.com
```

### Caching

Lookups are cached in-memory so repeated requests don't re-hit the registry. Caching is on by default, with a 1 hour TTL.
Set `ENABLE_CACHE=false` to turn it off, or `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` to change how long results are kept. Cached responses have `meta.cached` set to `true`.

If you're running on Vercel, `CDN_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (default 3600) and `CDN_CACHE_SWR_SECONDS` (default 86400) set the shared-CDN `Cache-Control`, so repeat lookups are served from the edge without re-invoking the function.

### Rate-Limiting

Requests can be rate-limited per-IP using a token bucket. It's off by default when self-hosting, but the public instance allows 30 requests/minute with a burst of 10. Set `RATE_PER_MINUTE` (use `0` to disable) and `RATE_BURST` to configure it. Clients that exceed the limit get a 429 with a `Retry-After` header.

To exempt trusted clients from the limit without locking down the whole API, set `API_KEYS` to a comma-separated list of keys, and have those clients send one in the Authorization header. (This is separate from `AUTH_KEY`, which makes the entire API private.)

### Timeouts

Each upstream RDAP/WHOIS lookup has a 5 second timeout. Set `LOOKUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to change it. Requests that time out respond with a 504.

### Bulk Limits

The `/multi` endpoint accepts up to 10 domains per request by default. Set `MAX_DOMAINS` to raise or lower this.

## Development

Prerequisites: You'll need [Go](https://go.dev/) installed. You will likley also want [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and/or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). The frontend is plain HTML/Alpine.js embedded into the binary, so there's no Node build step.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/who-dat.git
cd who-dat
go mod download
```

Then run `go run ./cmd/server`

Alternativley, build the Docker container with `docker build -t who-dat .`

---

## Web Interface

There's a very simple frontend included in the app. This is built with Alpine.js, so is super light-weight, and only adds about 17kb to the total executable.
The web interface is used to view WHOIS records for a given domain, and also hosts the API documentation.
